# Library of Congress Ebook Fetcher KOReader Plugin
I built a plugin for koreader that lets you browse, search for, and download pdf and epub books from the library of congress digital collections directly to your ereader. Put it in the koreader plugins directory, open it, set your downloads location in settings, and give it a whirl. Developed on a 2019 intel macbook pro and tested on my old jailbroken kindle paperwhite running koreader v2025.10. Enjoy.
