# Todo
* Add a link to the bookmark location
* I should ask the user how long the session should be and not how many cards to shown
* Choose a doc to get cards from
  * When a doc is open, by default only highlights corresponding to him should be shown
  * If "all" is chosen then choose at random and not sequentially
* Add a language card feature (https://github.com/koreader/koreader/issues/8734#issuecomment-1025397843)
* Add progress review feature aka show how many highlights from each doc are in what category (1d, 6d, ef)
* Maybe dont search books via the readhistory (and history in general), might limit me someday, ideally I want it to just run over all of the books
